Hello, my name is Jonathan Pereira. I am a student who is currently in the Year Up program and attempting to make my way through this
world of technology I now find myself in, prior to joining this program I had just finished my AA at Highline College in Des Moines, WA. 
Though the world of tech is fairly new to me I consider myself to be a quick learner, I live at home with my parents and two brothers.
